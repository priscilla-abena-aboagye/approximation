# Square Root Approximation
This project was done to check the approximation of a number based on a square target, tolerance and max iterations.

## Features
- Square Target: It is the number we want to check the square root of.
- Tolerance: It is how close we want the answer to be.
- Max iterations: Prevents infinte loop.
